  <p><section>Embarking on a profound spiritual journey, Siddhartha engaged in rigorous ascetic practices and meditation for several years. His quest culminated in the attainment of enlightenment, or "Bodhi," under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Tree">Bodhi tree</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya">Bodh Gaya</a>.
